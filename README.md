# **Linux From Scratch (LFS) Project**

## **What is Linux From Scratch?**
Linux From Scratch (LFS) is an incredible project that teaches you how to build your own custom Linux system entirely from source code. It’s not just about creating another Linux distribution — it’s about diving deep into the internals of Linux and understanding how everything fits together.

## **Why I’m Building LFS**
For me, LFS is more than just a project — it’s a learning journey. Here’s why I chose to work on it:
1. **To Learn How Linux Works**: 
   - I want to understand the core components of Linux and how they interact.
2. **Customization**:
   - Building a system that fits exactly what I need, without any bloat.
3. **Performance**:
   - Optimizing the system to suit my hardware and preferences.
4. **Challenge**:
   - Taking on the challenge of building a Linux system from scratch excites me.

## **My LFS Goals**
- Create a fully functional, minimal Linux system from the ground up.
- Automate repetitive steps using custom scripts to make the process efficient and reproducible.
- Document my journey and share insights for others who might want to take this path.

## **Steps in My LFS Build**
Here’s an overview of what I’m working on:
1. **Setting Up the Build Environment**:
   - Preparing disk partitions and creating the base environment.
2. **Building the Temporary Toolchain**:
   - Compiling essential tools like GCC and Binutils to bootstrap the process.
3. **Compiling Core Components**:
   - Installing the Linux kernel, Glibc, and other critical packages.
4. **System Configuration**:
   - Writing configuration files, setting up init scripts, and installing a bootloader.
5. **Finalizing and Booting**:
   - Completing the build and booting into my very own cust

## **What I’m Learning**
- How to compile and install software directly from source.
- The role of the Linux kernel, toolchain, libraries, and other essential components.
- The importance of attention to detail in every step of the process.
